IMPORTANT: if you intend to just USE the library
           (and NOT modify or port it), YOU NEED
           TO READ ONLY THE API DOCUMENTATION.
           There is a link to it directly from the
           documentation home page. If you don't find
           it, go to the file srAPI.h and syslogmessage.h
           for a description.

File testdrvr.c is a working sample program. You must edit
it because it contains a hardcoded IP address.

File testsrvr.c is a working sample server program. It is used to
demo the API - please don't expect it to be a full syslogd ;)
All it does is dump the message plus a few properties out to
stdout.

Thanks to Devin Kowatch, the library now compiles not
only under Win32, but also Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and AIX. I will 
move some more details on setting those things up.

There are two ways to build liblogging under linux/solaris.  
Method 1:
    Edit the 'makefile' to uncomment the needed bits to make it compile
    under your desired platform.
    run 'make'

Method 2:
    % cd <platform>
    % make
    Where <platform> is either linux or solaris
    
    
For AIX and FreeBSD, use the linux platform.

Many thanks to Albert Mietus for providing comments as well as some
syslog-sign code that I can use to pull ideas from.

Updates are always posted at the project web

I hope you will find the library useful,
