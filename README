See doc/index.html for the full documentation.

IMPORTANT: if you intend to just USE the library
           (and NOT modify or port it), YOU NEED
           TO READ ONLY THE API DOCUMENTATION.
           There is a link to it directly from the
           documentation home page. If you don't find
           it, go to the file srAPI.h for a description.

File testdrvr.c is a working sample program. You must edit
it because it contains a hardcoded IP address.

Thanks to Devin Kowatch, the library now compiles not
only under Win32, but also Linux, Solaris and AIX. I will 
move some more details on setting those things up.

There are two ways to build liblogging under linux/solaris.  
Method 1:
    Edit the 'makefile' to uncomment the needed bits to make it compile
    under your desired platform.
    run 'make'

Method 2:
    % cd <platform>
    % make
    Where <platform> is either linux or solaris
    
    
For AIX and FreeBSD, use the linux platform.

The directory structure will change in further
versions, but I am currently too busy implementing
new code to do this.

Updates are always posted at the project web
site at

I hope you will find the library useful,
Rainer Gerhards
