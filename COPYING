Liblogging currently is forced to use diffrent licenses for different
components.

COMPONENT  LICENSE
rfc3195    3-clause BSD
stdlog     2-clause BSD

Please note that you do *NOT* need to use the rfc3195 component if
you just want to use stdlog.

The different licenses are due to the fact that we cannot change the
license of the RFC3195 component without agreement from the
contributors. We are trying hard to make this possible.
