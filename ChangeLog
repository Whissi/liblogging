0.5.0         - fixed a bug in the server code where an <ok/> response
                for a channel close request was sent over the to-be-closed
                channel instead of channel 0. This can be an interoperability
                issue with 
              - implemented 3195/COOKED in the client. Server is still RAW
                only.
              - fixed some smaller bugs I don't remeber ;)
              - enhanced the client API to directly support sending
                syslog message objects. This is now the preferred way
                of sending messages.
              
              THE SERVER API MAY STILL CHANGE AND IS NOT FINALIZED IN 0.5.0!
              
0.4.0	      - fixed a hang condition on server shutdown (the listening
                sockets was accidently not in nonblocking state)
              - added support for parsing the syslog message
              - modified the directory structure, each OS will now have its
                own subdirectory (including Windows)
	          - included a syslog message API, which can also be used
                to create syslog messages
              - added support for syslog-sign-12 in the message object
0.3.1
   2003-08-29 - a good number of fixes
              - server (listener) API included
                WARNING: THE API IS NOT NECESSARILY STABLE YET. If you use it,
                         you may need to change your code with later releases
0.2.0
   2003-08-12 - socket layer restructured to facilitate porting
              - XML parser added
              - API stable, API changes will NOT break any programs written to 0.2.0 API
              - much better error checking
              - compiles & runs under Linux, FreeBSD, AIX, Solaris
     
0.1.0
   2003-08-04 Initial Release
