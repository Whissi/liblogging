0.4.0		  - fixed a hang condition on server shutdown (the listening
                sockets was accidently not in nonblocking state)
              - added support for parsing the syslog message
              - modified the directory structure, each OS will now have its
                own subdirectory (including Windows)
0.3.1
   2003-08-29 - a good number of fixes
              - server (listener) API included
                WARNING: THE API IS NOT NECESSARILY STABLE YET. If you use it,
                         you may need to change your code with later releases
0.2.0
   2003-08-12 - socket layer restructured to facilitate porting
              - XML parser added
              - API stable, API changes will NOT break any programs written to 0.2.0 API
              - much better error checking
              - compiles & runs under Linux, FreeBSD, AIX, Solaris
