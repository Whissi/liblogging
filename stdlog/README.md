This is the standard log component of liblognorm.

Supported Platforms:
--------------------
The library has at least successfully been build and
passed a short test on these platforms:

* Linux
* FreeBSD
* Solaris (10)

More platforms will be added as work progresses. In general,
we use fairly common C constructs, so chances are high that
the library builds on your platform even if it is not yet
listed.

If you run in to problems, please report them. If you know
how to fix problems, send a patch or pull request (e.g. via
github).
